# Cortico-striato-thalamo-cerebellar networks of structural covariance underlying different epilepsy syndromes associated with generalized tonic-clonic 

The authors have been very responsive to the comments made by myself and those of others. Relevant citations have been added. 

Assuringly, patient groups did not differ with regards to medication, and the reanalysis did not find a signficant interaction of medication. Thus I am more convinced that medication is unlikely to infleunce the key findings.

In their response to Reviewer 3, the authors specified a voxel-wise threshold of p < 0.01 for cluster level correction. It is now widely regarded in the field p < 0.01 is considered liberal. Given the relativelty large sample sizes of all 3 groups, I wonder whether the key results are retained if the more commonly-used threshold of p < 0.001 is used instead.
